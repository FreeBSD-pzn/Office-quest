#### This is older project which has been written on a Clipper (dBase III compiller)
```
   Be carefully all messages, comments and help files has been written
   with the DOS 866 code base.

   To compile sources files you need a Clipper compiller and
   executable files will run on a MS-DOS :).

   This project has been putted on a GitHub as an example of my expirience
   of programming.
